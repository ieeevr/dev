    <h1>Shop IEEE VR 2025</h1>
    <p>This year, in line with our sustainability policy, we are reducing the distribution of conference goodies. However, for those who are interested, we are offering the opportunity to purchase the official IEEE VR 2025 merchandise.</p>
    <h2 id="overview">Available Items</h2>
    <p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Official IEEE VR 2025 T-shirt:</strong> Available in both adult and children’s sizes. Please note that the t-shirts tend to run small. If you are unsure between two sizes, we recommend choosing the larger size.</li>
			<li><strong>IEEE VR 2025 Hoodie:</strong> A stylish option for cooler days.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		As part of our commitment to sustainability, we have chosen high-quality, eco-friendly products:
		<ul>
			<li>The t-shirts are produced in France by <i>Atelier Textile Français</i>, ensuring premium quality and ethical production standards.</li>
			<li>Printing is done locally in Brittany by <i>Atelier Monsieur Coton</i>, located less than 100 km from Saint-Malo.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
