    <p>This year, in line with our sustainability policy, we are reducing the distribution of conference goodies. However, for those who are interested, we are offering the opportunity to purchase the official IEEE VR 2025 merchandise.</p>

    <p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Official IEEE VR 2025 T-shirt:</strong> Available in both adult and children’s sizes. Please note that the t-shirts tend to run small. If you are unsure between two sizes, we recommend choosing the larger size.</li>
			<li><strong>IEEE VR 2025 Hoodie:</strong> A stylish option for cooler days.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Printing is done locally in Brittany by <i>Atelier Monsieur Coton</i>, located less than 100 km from Saint-Malo.</li>
		</ul>
