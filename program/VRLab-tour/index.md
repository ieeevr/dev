    <h1>VR Lab tour<div class="floatRight"><span class="eventconductSm"></span></div></h1>
    <p>
        The VR Lab tour is planned the day before the conference, on March 7th between 1:30pm  and 5:30pm, in the city of Rennes, which is located 1 hour by bus from Saint-Malo. A specific registration is required and it is limited to 100 places only. At the end of the visit, all attendants will be given the possibility to be taken to Saint-Malo by bus (estimated arrival to Saint-Malo at 19h00).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Rennes area encompasses one of the largest hubs of VR and AR research in France, including more than 150 research staff structured under four main research teams: <a href="https://team.inria.fr/seamless" target="_blank">Seamless</a>, <a href="https://team.inria.fr/virtus" target="_blank">Virtus</a>, <a href="https://team.inria.fr/combo" target="_blank">Combo</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/rainbow" target="_blank">Rainbow</a>. Tackling a wide range of research linked with VR and AR research, such as Avatars, Haptics, Biomechanics, Robotics, Human Perception, Human-Computer Interaction,  Neuroscience or Rehabilitation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the arrival of IEEE VR to Saint-Malo we would like to enable the opportunity for IEEE VR attendants (limited number of places) to visit the different facilities located in Rennes (60km from Saint-Malo). The visit will encompass the two main platforms on the Rennes hub, Immersia and Immermove.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>Immersia platform</strong> is a cutting-edge VR facility located at the <strong>Inria Center at Rennes University / IRISA</strong> research institute, it features a large-scale, high-resolution VR display (CAVE) and tools for natural interaction, such as motion tracking and haptic feedback. These capabilities support detailed visualizations and seamless engagement, making it a valuable resource for diverse fields, including urban planning, cultural heritage, arts, healthcare, and scientific research. It supports academic and industrial projects, fostering partnerships with regional, national, and international organizations.

    <p>
        The <strong>Immermove platform</strong>, also features a large-scale, high-resolution VR display (CAVE) enclosed in a sports gymnasium fully equipped with motion capture systems, designed for interdisciplinary applications, supporting research in fields like biomechanics, robotics, cognitive sciences, and ergonomics. It is used to explore how people move, perceive, and interact in virtual environments, with applications ranging from rehabilitation and sports training to vehicle simulation and human-robot interaction. By bridging motion technology with immersive environments, Immermove contributes to advancements in both fundamental research and practical innovations across multiple domains.
