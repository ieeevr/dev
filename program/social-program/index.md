        The entire IEEE VR 2025 organising team is delighted and proud to welcome you to this French edition of the conference. For the many participants who will be joining us in Saint-Malo, we also look forward to welcoming you to this spectacular setting. The conference offers you the best scientific, technical, professional and artistic programs, and we're also glad to be able to offer you a social program that allows you to make the most of the conference, the place where it is being held, and to enjoy each other's company, creating, consolidating or enjoying all the links that bind us together.

		<h2>Welcome Reception</h2>
		<p>The Welcome Reception will take place on Monday 10 March at 6pm, in the Palais du Grand Large. Check for the area between the Chill Area and the Exhibition, right next to the XR Gallery! We look forward to welcoming you there! This will be the perfect place to meet the community that makes up the conference audience, catch up with colleagues, meet academics, students, professionals or artists, and enjoy a moment of relaxation. We will be happy to serve you refreshments and petits fours (100% vegetarian, 100% tasty).</p>

		<h2>Gala Dinner</h2>
		<p>Ready for the "Corsaire" experience? We look forward to welcoming you to the Gala Dinner, Tuesday 11 from 7.30pm. Dinner opens at 8pm. Make sure to be there a bit before 8… As things may happen. Make also sure to stay to the very end of the dinner, other things may happen. The location for the gala dinner is not exactly at the Palais du Grand Large, but just in front of it, next to the harbour. See you at the "Quai Saint Malo". Prepare for immersion in the deep ocean atmosphere and more…</p>

		<h2>The Ephemere IEEE VR Runners group</h2>
		<p>Saint-Malo, and even more so the area around the Palais du Grand Large, is an ideal place for runners. We've set up the following discord channel so that you can run alone or with others, swap routes or arrange to meet up: <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/1327370157269450775/1343608867598241868"></a><br>The best places to run in the immediate vicinity of the conference are undoubtedly the seawall at Plage du Sillon, Pointe de la Varde and the Parc de la Cité d'Aleth. Please come to us to know more about these locations.</p>

		<h2>Enjoying Saint-Malo and surroundings</h2>
		<p>Depending on whether you have an hour or a day, whether you want to explore the area or take home a souvenir, we're happy to give you any suggestions to help you enjoy Saint Malo and the surrounding area. We will soon provide a link to a page with suggestions for visits in the immediate surrounding of the conference venue. You can also contact us (<a href= "mailto: socialevents2025@ieeevr.org">socialevents2025@ieeevr.org</a>, <a  href="https://discordapp.com/channels/1327370157269450775/1327376331972804649"></a>) or search for the social events chairs around the Chill Area for any specific question.</p>

	<div id = "MtStMichel">
		<h2>The Mont-Saint-Michel tour</h2>
		<p>Mont Saint-Michel, one of France's most visited monuments, is only 50 km from the town of Saint-Malo, in the heart of the exceptional bay that surrounds it. The time required to visit the mount has not allowed us to include it fully in the conference program, but we can help you organize a visit to the site, at a competitive cost. To this end, we have organized for you, albeit at your own expense, an organized tour of the mont on Thursday March 13, starting at 9am. If you missed the deadline to register for the tour, we can still help you get there on your own.</p>
