		<h2>Welcome Reception</h2>
		<p>The Welcome Reception will take place on Monday 10 March at 6pm. The reception will take place in the Palais du Grand Large, in the area between the Chill Area and the Exhibition, right next to the XR Gallery! We look forward to seeing you there! This will be the perfect place to meet the community that makes up the conference audience, catch up with colleagues, meet academics, students, professionals or artists, and enjoy a moment of relaxation. We will be happy to serve you refreshments and petits fours (100% vegetarian, 100% tasty).</p>

		<h2>The Chill Area (& co.)</h2>
		<p>Ready for the "corsaire" experience? We look forward to welcoming you to the Gala Dinner from 7.30pm. Dinner opens at 8pm. See you at the "Quai Saint Malo". Prepare for immersion in the deep ocean atmosphere, and maybe a bit more…</p>

	<div id = "octopusHunt">
		<h2>The Octopus hunt</h2>
		<p>Ready for the big octopus hunt? We've scattered 10 octopuses around the accessible areas of the Palais du Grand Large. We'll soon tell you the rules of octopus hunting!</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "VRrunners">
		<h2>The VR Runners group</h2>
		<p>Saint-Malo, and even more so the area around the Palais du Grand Large, is an ideal place for runners. We'll set up a discord channel so that you can run alone or with others, swap routes or arrange to meet up. The link to the dedicated Discord channel will be shared here as soon as ready. <br>The best places to run in the immediate vicinity of the conference are undoubtedly the seawall at Plage du Sillon, Pointe de la Varde and the Parc de la Cité d'Aleth.</p>

	<div id = "pictureContest">
		<h2>The Picture Contest</h2>
		<p>More about the picture contest here very soon.</p>

	<div id = "enjoyingStMalo">
		<h2>Enjoying Saint-Malo and surroundings</h2>
		<p>Depending on whether you have an hour or a day, whether you want to explore the area or take home a souvenir, we're happy to give you any suggestions to help you enjoy Saint Malo and the surrounding area. We suggest you follow some of the advice on this page (link to a page about the surrounding area soon here) or meet us at the Chill Area for any specific questions.</p>

	<div id = "MtStMichel">
		<h2>The Mont-Saint-Michel tour</h2>
		<p>Mont Saint-Michel, one of France's most visited monuments, is only 50 km from the town of Saint-Malo, in the heart of the exceptional bay that surrounds it. The time required to visit the mount has not allowed us to include it fully in the conference program, but we can help you organize a visit to the site, at a competitive cost. To this end, we have organized for you, albeit at your own expense, an organized tour of the mountain on Thursday March 13, starting at 9am. For more information, please visit the dedicated page: <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2025/program/Mt-St-Michel-visit/">https://ieeevr.org/2025/program/Mt-St-Michel-visit/</a></p>
