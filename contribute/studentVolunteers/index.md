        Dedicated and enthusiastic student volunteers (SVs) are crucial for the organization of a successful conference. Serving as a student volunteer is also a great chance to meet and interact with scientists from the field of Virtual Reality. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Volunteering for VR 2025 is also an opportunity to gain academic service experience—an often-critical component of post graduate work—and valuable experience for future scientific event organization.
    </p>
