While commonplace, the application of sentiment analysis for assessing collaborative teamwork is limited. We present an exploratory study of sentiment analysis as a useful companion to established metrics of user collaboration in VR. We present results of paired users (N=14, Npairs = 7) completing a VR brainstorming task, and sentiment analysis on their conversation. We report on how the sentiment process maps to the Team Workload Questionnaire (TWLQ) and illustrate how this could be a valuable metric for supporting an enriched evaluation of collaborative VR.","I’ve Got a Feeling: Sentiment analysis for collaborative performance in VR","User Experience and Presence",L3fvj5xGAbQ

Here, we analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) data for VR-induced discomfort associated with display parameters. Increased discomfort correlates with higher low-frequency and lower mid-frequency EEG signal power, indicating changes in autonomic activity and cognition. Previous studies have not thoroughly examined the neural impact of individual display settings. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between the display settings and EEG patterns. Optimizing the settings can mitigate discomfort and improve VR experiences, promoting wider application of VR technology.","Exploring Display Parameters Associated with Cybersickness Using Electroencephalography","User Experience and Presence",1LE-EbZ5lGo

The first, a judo practitioner with 16 years of mid-air balance control training, and the second, a commuter accustomed to reading while commuting, showed suppressed beta activity between cognitive and sensorimotor domains in our EEG analysis, associated with better cognitive behavioral performance. The judo practitioner demonstrated stronger suppression and superior cognitive behavioral performance. These findings raise whether beta activity suppression between cognitive and sensorimotor cortical domains reflects compensatory reticular neuron activation in the deep brainstem under a proposed MS habituation mechanism.","Case Studies of Remarkable VR Motion Sickness Resistance: A Judo Practitioner and a Commuter","User Experience and Presence",uMdbq6ky9Nk

Deep learning models can predict CS, but require powerful resources, which is unsuitable for computationally constrained standalone VR (SVR) headsets. Using external computing resources can increase complexity. To address these gaps, we developed a framework for SVR devices where we trained deep learning models using physiological data, optimized the model, and deployed in the SVR headset to predict CS in real-time (during immersion) with minimum inference time.

However, phone-based HMDs can only track the user's head orientation, excluding head position. This not only stifles the user's immersion in the virtual environment, but also risks simulator sickness. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a fully-connected neural network that predicts the user's head position given the head orientation history and other information about the user's movement that can be tracked from phone sensors. To analyze performance, the model iterates over the test dataset, predicting the entirety of the dataset's positional displacement history.","A Machine Learning Approach to Expanding the Degrees of Freedom on Phone-Based Head Mounted Displays","User Experience and Presence",fqEDEDF1Lvs

Results showed blur and peripheral vignetting significantly improved typing accuracy and reduced keystroke intervals. Subjective evaluations supported these findings, indicating subtle visual modifications can enhance concentration without conscious awareness.
