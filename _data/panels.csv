panel-XR,"Where will extended reality and AI take us?",Wednesday 12th,15:15,16:15,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","This year, for the first time, IEEE VR will include a mixed reality panel, occurring simultaneously in VR and displayed live on the screen of the plenary room. Panelists will be equipped with a VR headset. Each panelist will be represented by a virtual body that resembles their own appearance. As well as the human panelists there will be a virtual agent of a very well-known historic researcher who was critical to the topic of the discussion, based on Large Language Model (LLM) and also represented by an avatar. This special guest will observe the panel discussion and occasionally will comment through GPT-based speech generation. The panel will be in two stages. First, there will be a discussion where the panelists are in VR in the same shared environment, but potentially located in different physical places around the convention centre or on the plenary stage. Second, they will come together physically on stage to discuss the experience including with the audience.<br> The scientific objective of the panel is to foster discussion about the future of AI and XR and how they are interrelated and will influence one another. AI can be used to help construct XR applications including everything from the design, modeling, and  programming, and also AI can be used in real time during an application - as in the example we are demonstrating with this panel. The general idea is based on the goals of constructing and testing the technology for AI to be used in meetings. Every meeting has an objective (even if it is just to ‘hang out’ and have fun), and the idea is to explore the extent to which AI can help the meeting realise its objectives, especially when things go wrong, such as in cases of abuse or harassment.<br> Also there are fundamental ethical issues raised through the use of AI, especially considering the European Union’s AI Act. For example, will it even be legal to have virtual human characters controlled by an AI in XR applications outside of research? We look forward to this exciting panel that will discuss issues relevant to all attendees of IEEE VR 2025!","<ul><li><b>Sylvia Pan (Goldsmiths, University of London) -  Moderator</b>: is a Professor of Virtual Reality at Goldsmiths, University of London.

panel-eco,"How to adapt our XR research practices in times of ecological crisis?",Tuesday 11th,15:15,16:15,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","In the face of escalating ecological challenges, the XR research community ought to critically assess and adapt its practices to promote environmental sustainability. This panel brings together informed academics and citizens to briefly introduce some background on the impact of digital activities, the carbon footprint of scientific conferences and discuss actionable strategies for reducing the ecological footprint of both XR research and conferences. This panel aims to foster a critical dialogue on transforming XR research practices to address the pressing demands of ecological sustainability, around the following topics:<br><ul><li>Ludovic Hoyet (Inria) and Marc Macé (CNRS) will introduce the topics covered in the panel, and will present an analysis of the carbon footprint of IEEE VR 2025. They will discuss methodologies for assessing emissions and propose measures to mitigate the ecological impact of such gatherings.</li><li>Solène Lambert (Sorbonne Université) will explore innovative approaches to organize academic conferences that minimize environmental impact. Drawing from her experience in organizing Para-CHI in Paris, a local alternative hub to CHI which was held last year in Hawaï, she will present models such as multi-hub conferences and virtual participation, discussing their effectiveness in reducing travel-related emissions while maintaining academic collaboration and knowledge exchange.</li><li>Marlène de Bank (Shift Project) will address the sustainability of digital technologies, in light of her work at <a href=\"https://theshiftproject.org/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">The Shift Project</a> and the report they produced on the environmental impact of XR. She will highlight the increasing carbon footprint of the digital sector, which currently accounts for 3-4% of global emissions and is growing by 6% annually. Her talk will emphasize the need for digital sobriety and responsible computing practices to curb this trend.</li><li>Peter Sturm (Inria) will talk about his transition from computer vision to sustainability sciences. He will provide a broader perspective by discussing indirect environmental and social impacts of research and technology that often outweigh direct impacts.</li></ul>","<ul><li><b>Ludovic Hoyet (Inria) - Moderator</b>: is a Research Scientist at the Inria Center of University of Rennes (France), and part of the Virtus team in which he conducts research on creating perceptually plausible virtual characters, in particular for real-time interactive applications.
