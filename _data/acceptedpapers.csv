P1007,P1007,Influence of haptic feedback on perception of threat and peripersonal space in social VR,"Humans notably interpret social interactions through nonverbal cues like body language, personal space, and touch. In VR, personal space violations can feel more severe, with psychological effects akin to real life. While ""personal bubble"" features in VR aim to prevent harassment, they may not suffice. This study evaluates how social touch influences personal space perception. Participants wearing a haptic compression belt encountered virtual agents displaying threatening or neutral behavior. Personal space violations were perceived earlier with angry agents and haptic feedback. Results align with previous studies, highlighting haptic devices' potential to refine VR social interaction design.","Vojt?ch Smekal: Maastricht University, Jeanne Hecquard: Inria, Sophie Khne: Maastricht University, Nicole Occidental: Maastricht University, Anatole Lécuyer: Inria, Marc J-M Macé: CNRS / Rennes 1, Beatrice de Gelder: Maastricht University"
P1008,P1008,The Reliability and Validity of the Avatar Embodiment Questionnaire,"We assess the reliability of the Avatar Embodiment Questionnaire (AEQ) proposed by Peck and Gonzalez-Franco through 2-5 repeated exposures, each approximately two-weeks apart. Participants were embodied in same or cross-gendered avatars and results were assessed using three common reliability analyses. For participants in same-gendered avatars, the AEQ demonstrated acceptable or better reliability. For participants in cross-gendered avatars, the AEQ demonstrated questionable reliability for the initial trial and acceptable to excellent reliability thereafter. Results support that the AEQ is a reliable questionnaire, however minor experimental design changes should be considered when using avatars that are diversely different from the user.","Tabitha C.

P1009,P1009,The Impact of Environment Design Bias on Working Memory,"This work investigates subtle design differences in virtual environments on women+ performance. Non-male participants completed the Stroop Interference Task in two virtual environments: a neutral and a stereotypically STEM environment altered by four wall posters depicting positive gender-neutral to positive male figures, such as Albert Einstein. Results support that participants in the stereotypical environment were more distracted and responded more slowly and less accurately than in the neutral environment. We emphasize the importance of bias awareness in study design, and recommend that researchers consider how their experiments could impact participants of all demographics, in order to enhance inclusivity and non-biased results.","Jack Schwanewede: Davidson College, Alice Guth: Davidson College, Tabitha C.

Specifically, we investigate the impact of a woman avatar wearing business or science attire during a stereotype threatening situation. Participants in a successful woman business avatar experienced gender stereotype threat while participants in a successful woman science avatar were instead buffered from gender stereotype threat. Further, subjective embodiment was a significant predictor of response measures such that participants with higher subjective embodiment scores had better cognitive performance. This work demonstrates the potential of the Proteus effect to promote and support traditionally marginalized groups.","Pauline W Cha: Davidson College, Fangyi Li: Davidson College, Tabitha C.

P1021,P1021,Complex Virtual Environments on All-In-One VR Headsets Through Continuous From-Segment Visibility Computation,"All-in-one VR headsets have limited rendering power which limits the complexity of the virtual environments (VEs) that can be used in VR applications. This paper describes a novel visibility algorithm for making complex VEs tractable on all-in-one VR headsets. Given a view segment, the algorithm finds the set of triangles visible as a camera translates on the view segment. The visibility algorithm supports static and dynamic VEs, and it solves visibility with either triangle, particle, or object granularity. The visible sets yield output frames that are virtually indistinguishable from ground truth frames rendered from the original VEs.","Voicu Popescu: Purdue University, Elisha Sacks: Purdue University, Zirui Zhang: Purdue University, Jorge Askur Vazquez Fernandez: Purdue University"

However, our study reveals that VR?s commonly assumed ability to facilitate PT is overstated. In a 2x2 design, we examined the effects of point of view (first-person, 1PP vs. third-person, 3PP) and a PT task on users' PT as thinking about others. Results showed that PT significantly improved only when participants were explicitly tasked with considering another's perspective. These findings highlight the importance of intentional design, emphasizing targeted tasks over mere viewpoint shifts to achieve authentic perspective-taking in VR.","Eugene Kukshinov: University of Waterloo, Federica Gini: University of Trento, Anchit Mishra: University of Waterloo, Nick Bowman: Syracuse University, Brendan Rooney: University College Dublin, Lennart E.

It detects and localizes the air-typing events in video streams and encodes the keystrokes? relative positions and temporal order. Then, high-precision inference can be achieved by applying a Transformer-based network to the spatial and temporal encodings of the keystroke sequences. Finally, AirtypeLogger can achieve a Character Error Rate of less than 0.1 as long as 7 air-typing events are observed.","Tongyu Zhang: Shandong University, Yiran Shen: Shandong University, Ning Chen: Shandong University, guoming zhang: Shandong University, Yuanfeng Zhou: Shandong University"

While HMDs offer lens adjustments for individual IPDs, modern Video See-Through Augmented Reality (VST AR) devices place cameras at fixed positions, potentially causing IPD-ICD mismatches and perceptual incongruencies. In a 2x3 mixed-factor evaluation, we used a near-field reaching task in VR and VST AR, including a feedback phase for perceptual calibration. Linear Mixed Model analysis indicated differences between VR and VST AR, a notable effect of IPD-ICD mismatch, and their interaction. These findings underscore the importance of matching IPD and ICD in depth-sensitive XR applications and practical design considerations.","Franziska Westermeier: Human-Computer Interaction Group, University of Wrzburg, Chandni Murmu: Clemson University, Kristopher Kohm: Clemson University, Christopher Pagano: Clemson University, Carolin Wienrich: University of Wrzburg, Sabarish V.

To further reduce the implementation cost of the gaze tracking algorithm, FovealNet employs an event-based cropping method that eliminates over 64.8% of irrelevant pixels from the input image. Additionally, it incorporates a simple yet effective token-pruning strategy that dynamically removes tokens without compromising tracking accuracy.

The application of hand redirection to these replays by making movements appear larger or smaller than they actually are has the potential to improve motor function. We conducted two psychophysical experiments to evaluate how much discrepancy between replayed and actual movements can go unnoticed by users, both with hand redirection (N=20) and without (N=18).

P2357,P2357,Adaptive 360-Degree Video Streaming with Super-Resolution and Interpolation,"360ø video streaming requires considerable bandwidth, and previous research has proposed to apply super-resolution (SR) to solve this issue. However, most mobile devices lack the computational capacity to apply SR for all tiles in real time. To solve this problem, we utilize linear interpolation, which requires much less computational overhead. We develop a system that adaptively selects the most suitable downloading strategy, whether interpolation, SR, or ABR at the appropriate bitrate, for each tile to maximize user QoE while considering bandwidth limitations and computational constraints of mobile devices. Extensive evaluations show that our solution significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of QoE under various scenarios.","Siyuan Hong: The Pennsylvania State University, Ruiqi Wang: Pennsylvania State University, Guohong Cao: Penn State University"
P2358,P2358,360ø 3D Photos from a Single 360ø Input Image,"360ø images are a popular medium for bringing photography into virtual reality. While users can look in any direction by rotating their heads, 360ø images ultimately look flat. That is because they lack depth and thus cannot create motion parallax when translating the head. To achieve a fully immersive VR experience from a single 360ø image, we introduce a novel method to upgrade 360ø images to free-viewpoint renderings with 6 degrees of freedom based on 3D Gaussian splatting. To fill plausible content in previously unseen regions, we introduce a novel combination of latent diffusion inpainting and monocular depth estimation with Poisson-based blending. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering speed.","Manuel Rey-Area: University of Bath, Christian Richardt: Meta Reality Labs"
P2367,P2367,Immersion, Attention, and Collaboration in Spatial Computing: A Study on Work Performance with Apple Vision Pro,"Spatial computing will enable focused work through a higher degree of immersion and collaborative work through enhanced integration of shared interactions. With the Apple Vision Pro, the level of immersion can be adjusted seamlessly. As a first study, the present work investigates different levels of immersion while solving various tasks with the Apple Vision Pro. Selective attention improves significantly with increasing immersion levels. In contrast, social presence decreases with increasing immersion. In addition, we could not determine any adverse effects on depth perception after use. The present study provides an initial contribution to the systematic investigation of various conditions of spatial computing on work performance.","Carolin Wienrich: University of Wrzburg, David Obremski: University of Wrzburg"
P2370,P2370,Cognitive Load Inference Using Physiological Markers in Virtual Reality,"We conducted a largescale study (N=738) to collect behavioral and physiological measures under different cognitive load conditions in a VR environment, and developed an AI model to predict cognitive load in real time. Our model predicts cognitive load as a continuous value from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 correspond to the lowest and highest reported cognitive loads across all participants. Besides the point estimation, our model quantifies prediction uncertainty using a prediction interval. We release data from 100 participants. This dataset includes recordings from multiple sensors (pupillometry, eye-tracking, and pulse plethysmography), self-reported cognitive effort, behavioral task performance, and demographic information.","Jishang Wei: HP Labs, Erika H Siegel: HP Labs, Prahalathan Sundaramoorthy: HP Labs, Ant“nio Carlos D Almeida Gomes: HP Inc., Shibo Zhang: HP Inc., Mithra Vankipuram: HP Inc, Kevin Lee Smathers: PG&E, Sarthak Ghosh: HP Inc., Hiroshi Horii: Samsung Research America, Jeremy N.

P2391,P2391,Comparing Vibrotactile and Skin-Stretch Haptic Feedback for Conveying Spatial Information of Virtual Objects to Blind VR Users,"Perceiving spatial information of a virtual object is critical yet challenging for blind users. To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic cues---vibrotactile and skin-stretch---in conveying the spatial information of a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We conducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive static and moving objects. Our results reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's location and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to vibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both haptic cues and conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions.","Jiasheng Li: University of Maryland, Zining Zhang: University of Maryland, Zeyu Yan: University Of Maryland, Yuhang Zhao: University of Wisconsin-Madison, Huaishu Peng: University of Maryland"

P2399,P2399,The Impact of Avatar Retargeting on Pointing and Conversational Communication,"Retargeting user motion to avatars of different proportions changes the motion.  This paper presents three studies exploring how these motion changes impact functional and social communication for baseline forward (pose-preserving) and inverse (position-preserving) kinematics retargeting.  Pointing accuracy that can be maintained with full constraints on the orientation and position of the hand. Error increases for pose preserving retargeting, but can be minimized by a Semantic IK approach that offers a more natural pose.  Similar results are shown for gestures displaying object size.

P2403,P2403,Exploring Aiming Techniques for Blind People in Virtual Reality,"We explore how to support blind people in aiming tasks in VR using an archery scenario. We implemented three techniques: 1) Spatialized Audio, a baseline where the target emits a 3D sound to convey its location, 2) Target Confirmation, where the previous condition is augmented with secondary Beep sounds to indicate proximity to the target, and 3) Reticle-Target Perspective, where the auditory feedback conveys the relation between the target and the user's aiming reticle. In a study with 15 blind participants, Target Confirmation and Reticle-Target Perspective clearly outperformed Spatialized Audio. We discuss how our findings may support the development of VR experiences that are more accessible and enjoyable to a broader range of users.","JoÆo Mendes: Universidade de Lisboa, Manuel Pi‡arra: Faculdade de Ciˆncias, Universidade de Lisboa, Inˆs Gon‡alves: Faculdade de Ciˆncias, Universidade de Lisboa, André Rodrigues: Universidade de Lisboa, JoÆo Guerreiro: Universidade de Lisboa"
P2406,P2406,Comparing Absolute Size Perception in Optical See-Through Augmented Reality and Real World Viewing Using Verbal and Physical Judgments,"This empirical evaluation aimed to investigate how size perception operates between OST AR and the real world, using verbal reports and physical judgments. In a within-subjects experimental design, participants viewed target objects of different sizes in both AR and real-world conditions and estimated their sizes using verbal and physical judgment methods across multiple trials. Our findings revealed that participants consistently underestimated object sizes when using verbal reports in both AR and real-world conditions, with more pronounced errors in AR. In contrast, physical judgments yielded more accurate size estimates under both viewing conditions. The accuracy of verbal reports decreased as target sizes increased, especially in AR.","Chao-Kuo Chiu: National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Jung-Hong Chuang: National Chiao Tung University, Christopher Pagano: Clemson University, Sabarish V.

This study addresses the lack of clarity in selecting optimal hand interaction methods by evaluating three approaches?Attachment, Penetration, and Torque?across simple and precision-driven tasks. Our findings highlight that while Attachment offers simplified controls ideal for commercial use, Penetration and Torque hold potential for next-generation interactions. By examining technical features and trade-offs, we provide insights to help developers balance realism, usability, and satisfaction in VR applications.","Byungmin Kim: Korea University, DongHeun Han: Kyung Hee University, HyeongYeop Kang: Korea University"
P2432,P2432,Redirection Detection Thresholds for Avatar Manipulation with Different Body Parts,"This study examines how the body part controlling a VR avatar and the avatar?s appearance impact redirection detection thresholds. Experiments compared hand and foot manipulation of a hand-shaped avatar and an abstract spherical avatar. Results showed a 21% higher detection threshold with the hand avatar than the abstract avatar, regardless of the body part used. Redirecting the avatar toward the body midline increased thresholds by 49% compared to redirection away from it. No differences were found between hand and foot manipulations. These findings highlight the importance of avatar appearance and redirection direction for designing effective VR interactions.","Ryutaro Watanabe: The University of Tokyo, Azumi Maekawa: The University of Tokyo, Michiteru Kitazaki: Toyohashi University of Technology, Yasuaki Monnai: The University of Tokyo, Masahiko Inami: University of Tokyo"
