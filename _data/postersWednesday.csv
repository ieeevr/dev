In hysteroscopic surgery, movement of surgical tool is limited to the fixed entry point and there is no well-developed algorithm for these surgery scenes. We propose an 4 domain of freedom algorithm suitable for hysteroscopic surgery which can provide stable feedback force and realistic soft body deformation effect. Our energy-based algorithm for rigid-soft body haptic interaction can synchronize iterations with different update frequency. From the experimental results, users can operate in real-time with high stability and fidelity.","4-DOF Haptic Rendering for Hysteroscopic Surgery Simulation","Haptic  Feedback",IOxq26R8Q7A

While existing studies explored cues for shape discrimination, an underexplored question remains what the minimal haptic cue (one kind of the sensory cues) is sufficient for such discrimination with contextual cues in virtual environments (VE). This study examined whether the changes of force direction – as a haptic cue – could serve this sufficiency. The results of the study confirmed the sufficiency for the discrimination under certain conditions. This confirmation implied a potential of applying force direction to simplify the design of haptic cues for VE applications.","Haptic Shape Perception in Virtual Environments Using Force Direction","Haptic  Feedback",ZRDD5VQ2oNM

However, interacting with and controlling autonomous agents, whether virtual or real, through XR-DT can be challenging, and existing solutions often address only a certain level of collaboration or limited use cases. To address these limitations, this paper presents a no-code scenario authoring solution for XR-DTs called NEURONES as well as a demonstration scenario.","Authoring framework for industrial XR digital twin and autonomous agent : a proof of concept","Miscellaneous Topics",W928FWK4Lnk

In one condition this display is mitigated with a semi-transparent virtual window, while in another condition no such effect is presented.

To confirm the manipulation, we measured the perceived avatars' attractiveness. Results showed that participants found avatars at their ideal weight significantly more attractive, confirming an effective manipulation. Further, the ideal weight group showed a clear trend towards higher self-esteem post-exposure.","Do You Feel Better?
