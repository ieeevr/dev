10,IVL,"3rd Workshop on Immersive Visualization Laboratories - Past, Present and Future ",TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","Over the past 30 years, many research organizations established large-scale immersive visualization laboratories. Some have been very successful, but others are no longer around. With the recent availability of COTS virtual reality devices, the need for larger immersive visualization laboratories comes into question. Some immersive visualization laboratories have moved away from large scale facilities due to the cost of maintaining these more elaborate systems. But can immersive visualization requirements be satisfied solely using COTS VR devices used by researchers in their own office?
The goal of this workshop is to gather practitioners from immersive visualization laboratories to share their success stories, information about their hardware setups and the software they used and/or developed. Discussion can also include not-so-successful stories with lessons learned and workshop participants will also come together to discuss the future of large-scale immersive visualization labs.

11,ReDigiTS,"3D Reconstruction, Digital Twinning, and Simulation for Virtual Experiences",TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","Today, Virtual Reality (VR) technology is becoming foundational across a wide range of application domains, alongside other immersive technologies within the Extended Reality (XR) spectrum. Areas in which XR technologies and, in particular, immersive experiences have been successfully introduced are expanding daily, from traditional areas, such as entertainment and video game production, to novel scenarios, such as industry, healthcare, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles, to mention a few. The spread of VR is also driven by technological advancements that are making easier, and sometimes even possible, new ways of operating within virtual experiences. In particular, the availability of new hardware and software tools makes the use of “3D reconstructions”, “digital twins” and “simulations” commonplace in many XR applications. For example, the possibility to leverage networks with higher bandwidth than ever before and lower latency makes it possible to transmit the amount of data needed for massive, real-time digital twins, whereas high-performance hardware enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity digital objects and environments while lowering the time needed for high-demanding simulations. This workshop aims to attract a collection of high-quality submissions reporting research activities targeting the next generation of immersive experiences, reporting the latest ideas, methodologies, applications, evaluations, case studies, prototype implementations, preliminary results, and demos concerning 3D reconstruction, digital twinning, and simulation in VR and related technologies.",Alberto Cannavò,https://sites.google.com/view/redigits2025,TBD
12,KELVAR,2025 IEEE VR KELVAR Workshop: K-12+ Embodied Learning through Virtual and Augmented Reality,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","K-12+ (K-12 and higher ed) education is currently undergoing a technological revolution creating opportunities for Virtual-, Augmented-, and Mixed-Reality based learning (hereafter referred to as XR [extended reality] technologies. Technology integration will continue to increase as mobile devices penetrate all socioeconomic strata, and as XR technologies become affordable to schools, vocational education providers, universities, and informal educational settings delivered by cultural institutions such as museums, libraries and galleries. These technologies have the potential to facilitate effective learning by: developing the ability to engage students of all ages with interactive 3D simulations of real-life and artificial phenomena; presenting information that is spatially – and temporally – integrated with real objects; leveraging whole-body motions to depict and reinforce learning content. However, there are many questions about the integration of such experiences into the classroom, such as: What curriculum topics might be addressed through XR technologies? What socio-cultural, psychological and physiological mechanisms underlie embodied cognition? How can we design educational experiences that are appropriate for the different stages of human development? How will pedagogical and assessment approaches be influenced by such technologies? In this workshop we aim to bring together educators, developers and researchers who are interested in creating and deploying XR technologies for the educational contexts of the future.

14,VHCIE,9th Workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","Today, as virtual reality (VR) continues to evolve, various tools—including algorithms and systems—enable the creation and design of believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments (IVEs), making this area increasingly important. Sophisticated crowd simulations can efficiently populate city-sized environments with thousands of realistic virtual characters, called virtual agents, interacting with each other and with users. However, several challenges remain, particularly regarding the multimodal representation of interactions (such as haptic feedback for physical collisions, sound integration, etc.), the responsiveness of virtual humans at both verbal and non-verbal communication levels, and understanding the individual and situational factors affecting social interactions in populated environments. In addition, accessibility in virtual environments is an increased area of focus within the VR community. Ensuring that these social interactions are accessible to users of all abilities is essential. This includes addressing challenges like enhancing user interfaces for diverse needs, creating more inclusive social virtual spaces, and developing tools that support a wider range of physical and cognitive abilities, making virtual reality a more universally accessible medium for all. The goal of the VHCIE workshop is to foster discussions on the latest research related to these issues in a cross-community approach. Thus, we invite research contributions not only from the VR community but also from fields that contribute to understanding human behavior during social interactions - especially work with potential applications in VR or those exploring how to transition to VR settings.

15,IDEATExR,"2nd Workshop on Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, Transparency, and Ethics in XR",TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","The potential benefits of XR should be for all, regardless of their cultural background, gender identity, race, neurodiversity, ethnicity, economic status, age, etc. However, our community is still facing challenges preventing equal involvement.
Most research within this space relies on the M-WEIRD user populations and is done by M WEIRD researchers (Male, White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), effectively missing most of the world’s population, thus hindering the generalizability of findings and diversity of ideas. Approximately 95% of the global population is excluded from VR research and only 15% of first-paper authors at IEEEVR are women. Moreover, the ethics informing XR research have been identified as one of the grand challenges facing human-computer interaction research today, with the replication crisis featuring transparency as a critical step for remediation. These factors make formal discussions surrounding inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR not only timely but also necessary. And we want you to be part of this. It’s important to note that these concerns are also relevant to technical work not involving human participants as they also play a role in research teams, ideas, proposed solutions, conduct, etc. This workshop has six facets: inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics. We
expect researchers to submit early work that has already shown a commitment to one or more of these aforementioned facets. This could include work with diverse participants, work examining skin-tone rendering in AR, computer vision algorithms for differently-abled hands, testing of accessibility and usability of a VR app for those with different sensory abilities, etc. Further, while we anticipate this next type of paper to be rarer, we anticipate papers that feature research explicitly regarding the realm of diversity in XR. Finally, position papers informed by either a survey of the literature or profound experience in the facets of this workshop are also well within our scope.",Lee Lisle,https://ideatexr.carrd.co/,TBD

urgent need for accessibility in XR. Accessibility should be a primary design criteria for XR,
as retroactive accessibility is never as effective, and acting now will ensure the widest
possible access to XR as it proliferates. Aiming to make XR platforms more inclusive, the
workshop will provide a collaborative forum to share solutions, research, and hands-on
demonstrations for accessible XR. By fostering discussions and connections, the workshop
ensures accessibility becomes integral to XR innovation, inspiring new contributors and
advancing real impacts in users lives. A goal of the workshop is to engage attendees who are interested in, but not yet working on XR accessibility, and unsure where to start or what to work on.",​Bobby Bodenheimer,TBD,TBD
17,ARCHERIX,1st Workshop Archaeology and cultural heritage through XR,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","In the same way as 3D, innovative uses for XR are beginning to emerge in the field of historical sciences, on the initiative of archaeologists, anthropological biologists, paleopathologists and conservator-restorers. These technologies are opening up a new era in the knowledge, conservation and dissemination of archaeological and more generally cultural heritage data. Fundamentally interdisciplinary, they are revolutionizing practices and
raising new concerns and issues. XR based methods provide powerful interactive and non-destructive access to fragile historical material and immediate information. Furthermore, new approaches that combine analytical tools (ct-scan, archaeometry) and AI based methods to XR might benefit the cultural heritage domain, providing high-resolution digital twins of movable or immovable artifacts that allow for digital restoration, prediction of future (de-)generative natural processes, scientific exploration and communication to a broader audience. In addition, XR provides a powerful opportunity for the preservation and dissemination of intangible heritage such as traditional culture and folklore.
However, the production of heritage related environments in XR raises a number of questions of both a methodological and technical nature. Indeed, the nature and construction of such interactive 3D digital environments combine real elements, or at least those obtained by digitizing the real thing, with interpreted elements. The latter may be linked to a previous complete environment to represent missing elements, or to data created by the users during virtual work sessions to enrich the environment with the help of tools offered to them.
It is important to define a methodology for controlling and representing these different levels of data in the XR environment, and to assess the cognitive relationship between the expert users and these representations. The goal of this interdisciplinary workshop is to bring together in one place researchers specialized in XR and CH users such as archaeologists, restorers and curators. While each participant will contribute his or her own
expertise, experience and point of view, the workshop should also serve to strengthen cooperation and partnerships between disciplines.",Ronan Gaugne,https://sites.google.com/view/archerix/welcome,TBD
18,MRSI,Mixed Reality Safety and Interaction,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","As Mixed Reality (MR) aims to be more prevalent in homes, schools, and workplaces, user comfort, health, and safety become increasingly important factors. Users should have confidence engaging with MR experiences, and feel comfortable and safe doing so for long periods of time. Comfort concerns can lead users to avoid or prematurely decline to use MR, even when the concerns can be mitigated. For example, in MR, some degree of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is reported by 30-40% of users, and these effects can persist for several hours after the experience. Costello divides health and safety concerns
into physical, physiological, and psychological factors. These factors should be considered across the population, including children, elderly, or people with disabilities or for specific professionals such as industrial workers or medical professionals.
Furthermore, MR experiences allow users to interact with virtual and physical elements simultaneously which makes for a compelling experience. This means virtual content overlapping physical entities or physical elements interacting with virtual elements. Such experiences can afford various interactions for the users, however the user may need to calibrate to more than 1 frame of reference in such situations. For example, when using their real hands to grab a virtual object that is overlaid on top of the real world (RW),
the user has to perceive the distance of the virtual object in relation to the RW while also referring back to their internal body schema. The three things may not be aligned causing more cognitive load for the user resulting in a poor user experience. Additionally, there are depth and occlusion considerations to determine how successful certain actions will be. Depending on the relation between the virtual and the physical, the perceived affordance of actionable space may be inaccurate. In other words, a virtual object might appear reachable but it is beyond grasp. There are relatively few venues for discussing challenges associated with comfort, safety. and affordances in MR, particularly across ages and/or special populations. This workshop will provide an opportunity for academic and industry researchers to share their insights via presentations and active discussions. Providing both structured and more free-flowing options to share ideas will foster conversations and shared knowledge.",Ayush Bhargava,TBD,TBD

20,PerGraVAR,Perception-driven Graphics and Displays for VR and AR,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","In the last decade, a range of high-quality HMDs has become available on a commodity
level. While pixel densities and the dynamic range increase, the refresh rates are getting
higher and higher, and display latencies are continually reduced. Currently, novel
technologies such as displays with a growing number of displayed views per pixel (ranging
from stereo, multi-view, holographic, lightfield displays, optical see-through, and video
pass-through displays) are being released to the market. These advancements not only
enhance visual experiences but also highlight the need for improved interoperability across
XR platforms, addressing challenges in ensuring consistent performance and user
experience across diverse devices. Likewise, multi-layered displays and adaptable lenses
are integrated into head-mounted devices. Prototypes for retinal displays and bionic contact
lenses have begun to emerge.
All these advances in display technologies will tighten the requirements for image
synthesis techniques. Today, displaying realistic-looking graphics at high refresh rates is
already computationally demanding, especially for high pixel densities, a wide Field of View
(FoV), and when rendering in stereo. Also, as the size of datasets continually increases, a
larger FoV makes it possible to present more of this information at once. It is evident that this
divergence between display technologies and rendering techniques will cause significant
issues on the technical side (e.g., limited computing power, bandwidth, battery life, power
consumption, and heat generation) and can have severe implications on the mental and
cognitive load. Understanding these implications is crucial for developing systems that
enhance user experience without overwhelming users. However, the visual system has
some limitations and the highest possible visual quality is not always necessary. The
knowledge of those limitations can be used to develop more efficient rendering systems,
e.g., by foveating pixel density. Today, displays allow for more direct and complete
addressing of the human visual system and eye-tracking hardware enables to perform active
measurements of the gaze. Therefore, knowledge about perceptual processes is gaining

increasing importance. Yet no platform allows for discussing those techniques and systems
that take advantage of the human visual system under a common banner.
This workshop aims to bring together a group of experts to discuss perceptual findings,
identify challenges, and present the latest research in the field of perception-driven rendering
and perceptual displays. The gained knowledge, for example on display technologies, new
interactive rendering techniques, eye tracking systems, and how to optimize the
aforementioned techniques to be congruent with human capabilities and limitations will
provide novel methodologies and systems.",Martin Weier,TBD,TBD

22,ANIVAE-2025,8th IEEE VR Internal Workshop on Animation in Virtual and Augmented Environments,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","Animation is a comprehensive and heterogeneous media form. Often associated with cinema and television, animated images have entered many areas of life, particularly games,
installations, or data visualizations, taking on operative, communicative, epistemic, and
didactic tasks, among other things. In this context, Suzanne Buchan (2013) speaks of pervasive animation, a media world in which animated images are omnipresent. In one of the most innovative fields of media production, augmented and virtual reality, animation is an integral part of artistic, scientific, and economic applications in animated forms as well as mixed with live-recorded footage. In both fields, generative AI is applied in various aspects of production.
Within the animation process, it assists, for example, in story development and animatics,
character design and animation, or virtual-scene creation. For AR/VR it is not only useful for
procedural content creation but also enhances interactive and dynamic environments, scene
and context understanding, and creates more complex avatars or non-player characters.
Connecting specialists from various digital humanities research areas (such as animation,
games, and media studies) with experts from vision-oriented computer science areas (such as computer graphics, information visualization, or AI) and experts from technically oriented
computer science areas (such as data integration, internet of things, or smart automation), the ANIVAE workshops aim to create an open and exciting environment. By encouraging

27,NGA,Next Generation of Avatars,TBD,TBD,TBD,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","Recent advances in deep learning, neural representations, and physics-based character
simulation... have contributed to a breakthrough in avatar design, simulation, control and
rendering. Computer vision now enables detailed and accurate pose and shape capture with
affordable systems (e.g. a single RGB camera) in real-time, and to build controllable
representations of specific users instead of anonymous virtual humans. In particular, advances in image-based rendering, such as NERF or Gaussian Splatting, also offer new challenges to control high quality avatars, opening new questions about avatar control, and its impact on human experience in VR. Novel view synthesis based on sparse views of the user may be a promising alternative to traditional character simulation, especially in teleoperation and telepresence applications, among many others. Furthermore, motion control including retargeting and interaction are still open and difficult problems, that may benefit from the above-mentioned new representations. How to retarget the motion of the user on an avatar simulated with these new representations? In traditional rendering pipelines, how to benefit from new information, such as the surface of the user, to adapt the pose of the avatar in real-time? Alternatively, how to control this avatar, with all the possible representations, using only a few sensors (e.g. controllers, inertial sensors...)? All these new possibilities may have various impacts on the user experience. How can new representations, new control metaphors or devices, and new ways of doing character simulation, enhance the VR experience of users?
How can we evaluate these new methods to measure the degree of interaction, embodiment,
agency, and impact? What are the potential risks and limitations of these approaches from the user perspective?
