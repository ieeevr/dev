Each dancer inhabits a dynamic Voronoi-generated 'cell' that displays real-time biofeedback signals—including heartbeat and pressure levels—as fluid boundaries. Through these interactions, 'Cell Space' fosters deep intercorporeal  connections, inviting participants and observers to explore the shifting boundaries between individual and collective intentionality while challenging conventional notions of embodied boundaries and dynamic spatial negotiation.",

'EchoVision' is a mixed reality art experience that simulates bat echolocation, letting participants step into a bat’s perceptual world. Using a custom-designed, handheld, batshaped mask built with the open-source HoloKit headset, participants explore echolocation through visual feedback that responds to their vocalizations as they bounce off the surrounding environment—all detected by LiDAR Scanner. Through this artistic simulation, users discover how bats navigate and perceive their world, fostering empathy for non-human perspectives.",

Emotion Synthesizer is an immersive art installation that investigates this evolving emotional landscape through the lens of extended reality. The installation combines XR technology, interactive visualization, and AI-generated content to create an immersive environment where viewers can observe and interact with their emotional states. Through real-time interaction and visualization, the installation establishes a unique dialogue between real and virtual emotional experiences. This work raises critical questions about emotional authenticity, selfperception, and the impact of digital information on emotional experiences in the contemporary technological era.",

Participants close their eyes and wait for the video to be projected. A video prepared in advance is played after being tilted bluish by the spectral compensation for the 'blood-red' unique to the participant’s own flesh. Here, the lid is also the medium for the very object it is trying to block off. The intended colors, their placements, and their motion can be sent, which realizes animation. However, this in no way implies the triumph of projection over closing the senses. In the privileged posture of the closed eye, the light of the video shares texture and fuses with the visual image of the unconscious. Multiple versions were produced, including a version in which the eyelids of participants lying down are connected by optical fiber to a suspended display pixel on the ceiling, and another version in which a laser projector projects images directly onto the eyelids of participants looking forward.",

The piece is opening the question on how to transfer a real live performative experience into augmented reality as well as the question of owning and maintaining agency within an artistic fabric. This is explored with a focus on the interaction of different types of agents, using artistic research at the intersection of art, dance, and technology.",

Participants wear goggle-type devices with cameras and displays. The display of every participant is connected to the camera of every participant. The displays show cinematic images edited by an 'algorithm' based on information about the participants and their environment, from the camera images of multiple participants, including themselves, through which the participants observe and act in the space. This paper outlines the series and describes a version that employs an algorithm 'when the object of awareness/seeing is shared, the vision is shared (the sharing of the view is done by temporal switching based on the timing of the participants' heartbeats).'",

Custom soundscapes evolve as viewers collect 'souvenirs', unlocking new sound patterns. Simple hand gestures drive the interaction, creating an intimate, poetic experience. In the final scene, viewers can draw their own memories in virtual space. Outside the headset, they are invited to share a personal childhood memory in a recording room for others to hear, completing the journey through memory, sound, and art.",

Visitors engage in a ritualistic act of whispering their dreams. Each dream transcription and corresponding visualization are temporarily stored in the memory of the AI system. After that, the ReVerie AI system makes an inference from this memory to generate a shared, evolving A/V experience, where participants fly through interconnected dream objects in a virtual space. At its core, ReVerie challenges the capacity of technology to authentically represent the intangible and private terrain of dreams. By inviting participants to contribute whispered dreams that are algorithmically transformed into 3D dream objects, ReVerie pushes them to confront whether such digitally synthesized representations can capture the true essence of our subconscious—or if they craft new forms of detachment or control over personal narratives instead.","The ReVerie will only be showcased on <b>Monday 10th(evening, opening at 6pm)</b> in the main amphiteater"

Participants wear original goggles equipped with a camera and HMD. First, the AI converts a single image from the camera into a single line of text. Next, the AI generates an image from that line of text. This image is then displayed on both eye displays. These processes occur in real-time, allowing the user to perceive and act on the real physical world through this redrawn view. This experience confronts, bodily and literally, the kind of radical virtual reality that is latent in a society that mediates sensory information (views in the broadest sense) under language: “The realities which become the same sentence is equivalent(v,irtual). It is also an attempt to appropriate some of the energy of today’s debate over artificial intelligence for a classical inquiry around the fact that “intelligence can only see the world under meaning.",
