PO1098,"Imagraph",Goki Muramoto,"The University of Tokyo, Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan",vr25_img_imagraph,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYCstLOPbDU,https://www.goki-muramoto.com/imagraph,"Imagraph is an optical apparatus that projects video onto closed eyelids, produced as a medium that mediates two primordial attitudes: projecting an image and closing the senses. Participants close their eyes and wait for the video to be projected. A video prepared in advance is played after being tilted bluish by the spectral compensation for the 'blood-red' unique to the participant’s own flesh. Here, the lid is also the medium for the very object it is trying to block off. The intended colors, their placements, and their motion can be sent, which realizes animation. However, this in no way implies the triumph of projection over closing the senses. In the privileged posture of the closed eye, the light of the video shares texture and fuses with the visual image of the unconscious. Multiple versions were produced, including a version in which the eyelids of participants lying down are connected by optical fiber to a suspended display pixel on the ceiling, and another version in which a laser projector projects images directly onto the eyelids of participants looking forward."

Participants wear goggle-type devices with cameras and displays. The display of every participant is connected to the camera of every participant. The displays show cinematic images edited by an 'algorithm' based on information about the participants and their environment, from the camera images of multiple participants, including themselves, through which the participants observe and act in the space. This paper outlines the series and describes a version that employs an algorithm 'when the object of awareness/seeing is shared, the vision is shared (the sharing of the view is done by temporal switching based on the timing of the participants' heartbeats).'"

PO1103,"ReVerie: Contemplating Agency and Truth in AI-assisted Immersive Dream Reliving",Pinyao Liu / Keon Ju M. Lee,"Independent Artist-Researcher/ School of Interactive Arts &Technology Simon Fraser University, Canada",vr25_img_reverie,https://vimeo.com/950273789,,"ReVerie AI installation explores the scientific concept of dream reliving. Visitors engage in a ritualistic act of whispering their dreams. Each dream transcription and corresponding visualization are temporarily stored in the memory of the AI system. After that, the ReVerie AI system makes an inference from this memory to generate a shared, evolving A/V experience, where participants fly through interconnected dream objects in a virtual space. At its core, ReVerie challenges the capacity of technology to authentically represent the intangible and private terrain of dreams. By inviting participants to contribute whispered dreams that are algorithmically transformed into 3D dream objects, ReVerie pushes them to confront whether such digitally synthesized representations can capture the true essence of our subconscious—or if they craft new forms of detachment or control over personal narratives instead."
PO1108,"Semantic See-through Goggles : One and Four Realities",Goki Muramoto,"The University of Tokyo, Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan",vr25_img_semantic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wy07jKqhEY,https://www.goki-muramoto.com/semantic-see-through-goggles,"Semantic See-through Goggles are a kind of glasses, through which the view becomes once a line of text and is re-depicted as a view. Participants wear original goggles equipped with a camera and HMD. First, the AI converts a single image from the camera into a single line of text. Next, the AI generates an image from that line of text. This image is then displayed on both eye displays. These processes occur in real-time, allowing the user to perceive and act on the real physical world through this redrawn view. This experience confronts, bodily and literally, the kind of radical virtual reality that is latent in a society that mediates sensory information (views in the broadest sense) under language: “The realities which become the same sentence is equivalent(virtual). It is also an attempt to appropriate some of the energy of today’s debate over artificial intelligence for a classical inquiry around the fact that “intelligence can only see the world under meaning."
