This study explores perceived benefits and risks of sharing personal info in AR social contexts. Analysis of participant interviews, conducted after presenting three AR scenarios, revealed benefits like targeted communication, networking opportunities, and fostering shared values, varying by scenario. Participants also identified risks like prejudgement, harassment, and diminished emotional connection, also shown to be context-dependent. These findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay between advantages and vulnerabilities of self-disclosure in AR, highlighting the need for systems addressing these concerns.","Perceived benefits and risks of information disclosure in augmented reality","Ethical and Psychological Aspects",njvFx6s3asM
