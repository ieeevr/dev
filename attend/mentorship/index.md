        <strong style="color: black">IEEE VR 2024: The 32<sup>nd</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces </strong>
        <br>
        March 8-12, 2025 | Saint-Malo, France
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the IEEE VR 2025 Mentorship Program is to connect newcomers to the conference (mentees) and experienced attendees (mentors) via shared interests. This program is a great networking opportunity for both mentees and mentors to learn about each other and the VR field in general!
    </p>    
    <h2>How do I participate?</h2>
    <p>
        nterested individuals can apply to the Mentorship Program after registering for the 2025 IEEE VR conference. Mentors and mentees will be matched by the program organizers based on different levels of IEEE VR experience and research interests and will be put in contact before the conference begins.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Interested participants should complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/69cqSoWzhBCMSuHp6" target="_blank">form</a> by <strong>February 21, 2025</strong>. This deadline is to give time for the committee to match mentors and mentees before the conference begins. First-time attendees will receive priority consideration for a mentor, and the mentorship program will be open to the most compelling 40 applicants, based on need and order of application.

    <h2>What is involved in this program?</h2>
    <p>
        Mentors and mentees are expected to participate in several activities together throughout the conference. Some suggested activities include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attending a paper session together and discussing afterwards</li>
        <li>Meeting during coffee breaks/meals to discuss research and/or general career guidance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We ask that the mentors also introduce their mentee(s) to at least <strong>one (1) colleague</strong> who is attending the conference. Preferably, this colleague will be someone at an institution that is different from the menteeâ€™s to encourage further networking. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Participants will also be asked to complete a <strong>closing survey</strong> providing feedback on the program after the conference.
    </p>
