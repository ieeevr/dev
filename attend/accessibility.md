    <h2>Accessibility of the Conference Center</h2>
    <p>
        Outside the Conference Centre, there is an access ramp parallel to the steps leading to the entrance of the Conference Centre. Once inside the Conference Centre, all our rooms are accessible to people with reduced mobility (including wheelchair users), thanks to the lifts that serve all levels and mezzanines. In the auditorium, with advance notice, they can remove certain seats to accommodate people using wheelchairs. In the amphitheatre, people using wheelchairs can sit at the back of the auditorium. The auditorium and amphitheatre stages are also accessible to speakers with reduced mobility thanks to lifts. If they have the information in advance, they will be able to have reserved areas in the various meeting rooms. <br><br>
        Accessible toilets are available on every level of the Conference Centre, ensuring convenience for all attendees.
